# jQuery dForm

The jQuery.dForm plugin allows you to create your HTML forms programmatically as JavaScript objects or 
as [JSON](http://json.org). Let the browser do the work and generate JavaScript enhanced forms without hassle. 

### You should try this plugin if you want to

* write JavaScript instead of HTML markup since your page doesn't run without JS anyway
* manage all your form related jQuery plugins in a unified way
* have an easy way to include jQuery UI elements and JavaScript validation
* scaffold forms from business objects of your server side framework
