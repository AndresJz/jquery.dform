The documentation and the minified JavaScript can be automatically generated by
in the build.xml file. The most recent builds are included for your convenience.

To build it yourself you will need:
- Ant (http://ant.apache.org/)
- Naturaldocs (http://www.naturaldocs.org/) for documentation generation

Ant targets:

min : Concatenates and minifies the source files to jquery.dform-<version>.min.js.
	The Google closures compiler used for minifying will be donloaded automatically
	if not found. 

doc : Generates documentation using Naturaldocs in the doc folder
